INTRODUCTION
Taxonomically, the Orthoretrovirinae (orthoretroviruses) and Spumaretrovirinae (spumaviruses) make up the two subfamilies of Retroviridae.  They share many similarities, including overall genome stuctures with gag, pol and env genes encoding proteins for replication as well as life cycles involving reverse transcription and integration into the chromosomes of infected cells.  However there are also a number of differences distinguishing the viral subfamilies.  These include finer details of genome organisation and the timing of reverse transcription.
The Gag proteins of orthoretroviruses and spumaviruses also display both important differences and similarities.   They are crucial for particle assembly, budding from the cell, reverse transcriptase and delivery of the viral nucleic acid into the newly infected cell.  However there are a number of striking differences including how the Gag precursor is targeted for the cell membrane as well as the absence of a Gag-Pol fusion protein in spumaviruses and very different patterns of processing during viral maturation. Thus Gag from all orthoretroviruses is proteolytically cleaved to form distinct, well-studied proteins, matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC), in mature virions whereas such processing is not seen in spumaviruses.
Despite encoding similar functions, there is no discernible similarity between the DNA sequences of orthoretroviral and spumaviral gag genes.  Our recent structural studies of the Prototypic Foamy Virus Gag protein (Goldstone et al, 2013; Ball et al, submitted) now permit comparisons at the structural level, allowing an examination of the evolutionary relationship between the retrovirus subfamilies.  Such an analysis is the subject of this report.
