However, an intriguing aspect of this relationship was an ambiguity in the degree of relatedness between the CA domains
of the Gag proteins, with the Spumaretroviral CA domains, NtDCEN and CtDCEN, appearing almost equally similar to either
the amino- (CA-NtD) or carboxy-terminal (CA-CtD) domains of the orthoretroviruses. 
With small domains that share a high degree of backgound similarity, particularly those composes entirely of \AHs,
it is very difficult to evaluate the significance of their structural similarity as chance combinations of a few
helices can give rise to an apparently convincing overlap with a low RMSD.

In this paper, we now investigate and clarify the nature of the relationship ibetween these capsid domains and discuss 
its evolutionary implications.  Our work provides a demonstration of a general approach to the resolution of
difficult comparison problems in which the proteins share a high intrinsic level of similarity.
