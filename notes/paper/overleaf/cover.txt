Dear Structure,
We submit the our paper on retroviral capsid comparison which shows structural
evidence for early gene duplications.   We believe this observation will be of
considerable interest to many researchers in the retroviral field and those
with a wider interest in viral evolution.
Yours,
Willie Taylor and co-authors
