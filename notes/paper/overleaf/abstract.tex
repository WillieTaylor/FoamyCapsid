The {\em Spumaretrovirinae} (foamy viruses) and the {\em Orthoretrovirinae} (e.g. HIV) share
many similarities both in genome structure and the sequences of the core viral encoded proteins,
such as the aspartyl protease and reverse-transcriptase.  Similarity in the Gag region of the 
genome is less obvious at the sequence level but has been illuminated by the recent solution of
the foamy virus capsid (CA) structure.   This revealed a clear structural similarity to the 
orthoretrovirus capsids but with marked differences that left uncertainty in the relationship
between the two domains that comprise the structure.   Using multiple structure comparison
methods combined with statistical tests, we have shown that the relationship of the two domains
conforms to a simple linear correspondance rather than a domain transposition.   These
similarities suggest that the origin of both viral capsids was a common ancestor with a double
domain structure.  In addition, we show that there is also a significant structural similarity 
between the amino and carboxy domains in both the foamy and ortho viruses which suggests that
there may have been an even more ancient gene-duplication that preceded the double domain structure.
